        <h3 class="text1-1">HISTORY</h3><br>
        <p> Do you know what the Pokémon World is about and how it works? This universe emerged thanks to the popular game franchise created by Nintendo and it is much bigger and more complex that you can imagine. Believed that the Pokémon World is just our
            current civilization a few years into the future. However, many forget that their history has always been influenced and affected by Pokémons. As far as we know, the creator of the Pokémon World is the legendary Arceus. He created Dialga,
            Palkia and Giratina to be the guardians of the time, espace and chaos. <br>After that, Arceus gave life to Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit for them to create willpower, knowledge and emotions, respectively. These Pokémon mentioned above can be considered
            gods within the franchise. Besides that, there are several caves and ancient cities that reveal that the Pokémon helped form the human civilization. The most famous example is the Ruins of Alph, that imply that humans have developed their
            languages ​​with the help of the most varied forms of the Unowns.</p>

            <h3 class="text2-2">The Geography of the Pokémon World</h3><br>
            <p>As many have known since the time of the franchise games, the Pokémon world is divided into regions that are inspired by real world locations. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh are inspired in geographic areas of Japan (in this project we present
                Kanto and Johto). The geography of the Pokémon World was created after a duel between the lengendary Groudon and Kyogre, who tried modify the planet, each one in your favor.<br>After that, the continents have been modified again thanks
                to the interference of Regigigas, that with your power, created as regions that we know within the Pokémon World. But before the Pokémon caused more changes, he was sealed by Regis (that, as far as we know, may have been created by humans)
                in the region of Sinnoh. And many of the caves within the Pokémon World were a constructions of Pokémon of the terrestrial type. A good example is the cave of the Digletts, which is in the Kanto region.</p>

            <h3 class="text3-2">THE HUMAN CULTURE</h3><br>
            <p>Yes, the human society of the Pokémon World had to learn to coexist with the powerful little monsters. An important focus of this society is the hunting and training of Pokémon for duels and competitions, but we know it goes far beyond that.
                For example, electric-type monsters help supply homes and buildings with electricity; those who fly take people back and forth (even with cars, boats and planes), some help with construction and others are fundamental to maintaining some
                ecosystems.
                <br>It is also important to remember that in some cultures in certain regions, some Pokémon are venerated by population.In Johto, in the city of Ecruteak, there were Torres Tin and Brass, where the legendary lived Lugia and Ho-oh. But
                when the second was destroyed in a fire, they left the place. Three little monsters died in this tragedy, but they were revived by Ho-oh and became Raikou, Entei and Suicune.</p>
